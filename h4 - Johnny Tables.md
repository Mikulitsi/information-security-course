- I had already done this task but didn't get screenshots so that's why it shows that nothing was upgraded or installed in the screenshots.

- In the end of installing Webgoat and running it, it gives the link to browse Webgoat.

## b) Webgoat 2023.4: General: Developer Tools
- First task required to open the console and add input webgoat.customjs.phoneHome(). Adding the input gave a phone number that had to be copied and pasted.

- After clicking the request button, I go the inspect mode and go to network. I find the network file there, click that and then click the request tab. Inside that request tab was the number needed to complete the task.

## c) Update all operating system and all applications in your Linux

- I needed commands:
  - sudo apt update
  - sudo apt-get upgrade
  - sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
 
- I had done this earlier already so that's why it shows that nothing was updated in the screenshots.

## d) SQLZoo
