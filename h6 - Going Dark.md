# h6 - Going Dark

## Quintin 2014
- Tor's underlying cryptographic protocol has not been compromised, however there are weaknesses and risks associated with bad user configurations which can be exploited. 
- Tor is utilized by many kinds of users. Not just criminals but by activists, journalists, families and the military, to mention a few.
- Tor has no military backdoor. While it was funded by the US Navy, the software is open source.
- At the moment, it's legal to operate Tor relay in the US, and no one has ever been charged for operating a relay. There are a few individuals in the US who operated exit relays and had police show up at their door, but no one has gotten arrested for it.
- Using Tor is convenient with the Tor Browser Bundle or Tails operating system, as they both require little to no technical expertise.
- Tor's speed is slower than normal browsers, though it is constantly improving with a developing software and a growing number of relays.
- Tor is not perfect and anonymity can be compromised by using outdated software or by any enemy who is able to monitor and correlate traffic from both ends of the connection.

### Introduction

- Tor (The Onion Router) is an anonymous communication network.
- It was developed to protect the privacy of its users on the internet.
- Journalists, activists, and criminals all use TOR.
- It provides anonymity about the userâ€™s identity and activity.

### History and Intended Use of The Onion Router

- Developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in the mid 90s. 
- The goal was to protect government communications and protect intelligence sources. 
- It was released to allow people a safe way of being anonymous. 
- Nowadays the Tor Project which is a non-profit group, maintains it. 
- It can be used properly for privacy, free speech, and avoiding censorship. 
- It can be used improperly for illegal trade and the dark web.

### How The Onion Router Works

- Onion routing (backed by multiple encryptions) is employed.
- The data is sent to three randomized nodes (or relays):
  - Entry - which knows the user information.
  - Middle - which just passes data to the next relay.
  - Exit - which knows the destination information.
- Each level is decrypted at each relay location.
- No single relay has knowledge of both the source and destination information.
- This creates reasonably good anonymity and more difficulty in tracing, but the browsing speed is slower.
  
### Tracking Criminals Using TOR

- It can be done, but it is not easy.
- Investigators examine these data types:
   - Traffic analysis
   - Exploit web browser (Malware injection)
   - User error (Generally breaking anonymity by identification)
- They work with ISPs and host companies.
- Tor is not perfect, and like previously mentioned, user error will break anonymity.
- Law enforcement employs a "digital forensics" and "digital intelligence" strategy to identify users.

## Tor

I started installing Tor with command `sudo apt-get install torbrowser-launcher` though first I got an error message. I could fix this with running command `sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list` to see the repository list, then I added the word `contrib` to every line that did not start with `#` and that helped to fix the issue once I ran the command `sudo apt-get install torbrowser-launcher` again. After the install was finished, I ran the command `torbrowser-launcher` and as can be seen from the screenshot below, it starting downloading Tor Browser for the first time.

After it finished downloading, Tor Browser opened like seen in the screenshot below and that was all with the installation process

As you can see the search engine used by Tor is `DuckDuckGo` and it gives an option to onionize the search to give more privacy. 

In the class then we got to know from our teacher Tero about a search engine for Tor, which has an onion available, named `Ahmia`. As it says in the screenshot below, Ahmia searches hidden services on the Tor network and has some content filtering to filter abusive content.

For marketplace I just searched marketplace on Ahmia and from that I found this marketplace called `Anonymous Marketplace`. Never heard of this before and I have no idea if this is just a spoofed website of some real marketplace but some of the things here seem too good to be true and for me rings bell that this might be a scam website alltogether even though as you will see from the screenshots below, it does have a review section but there's no way for me to know those are actually real reviews...

Forums were harder to find but I eventually found from Ahmia this `Hacker forums` website which seems to list all available and closed forums and communities in Tor.

From that list I picked a forum called `NulledBB`. It seems to have all kinds of stuff in its forums. I could have also used it as my marketplace section seeing that it has its own marketplace. Don't really know what to think about this forum.

And lastly for my big organization pick, I chose DW aka `Deutsche Welle`. It is a big German state-funded network broadcaster proving news from all over the world.
