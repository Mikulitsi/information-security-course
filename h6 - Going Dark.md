- Tor's underlying cryptographic protocol has not been compromised, however there are weaknesses and risks associated with bad user configurations which can be exploited. 
- Tor is utilized by many kinds of users. Not just criminals but by activists, journalists, families and the military, to mention a few.
- Tor has no military backdoor. While it was funded by the US Navy, the software is open source.
- At the moment, it's legal to operate Tor relay in the US, and no one has ever been charged for operating a relay. There are a few individuals in the US who operated exit relays and had police show up at their door, but no one has gotten arrested for it.
- Using Tor is convenient with the Tor Browser Bundle or Tails operating system, as they both require little to no technical expertise.
- Tor's speed is slower than normal browsers, though it is constantly improving with a developing software and a growing number of relays.
- Tor is not perfect and anonymity can be compromised by using outdated software or by any enemy who is able to monitor and correlate traffic from both ends of the connection.
