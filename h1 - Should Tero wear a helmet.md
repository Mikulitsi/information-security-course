## Threat modeling

### Braiterman et al 2020

- Threat modeling means examining all the ways our systems could be compromised and determining how to prevent or protect against these risks before they occur.
- The threat modeling manifesto acts as a guide for creating or improving a threat modeling method that meets the organizationâ€™s needs.
- Key questions of threat modeling are:
  1. What are we working on?
  2. What can go wrong?
  3. What are we going to do about it?
  4. Did we do a good enough job?

### Shostack 2022

- STRIDE categorises risks into: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of Privileges.
- Risk management and threat modeling go together. Risk management calculates the likelihood and effect of a threat. It helps to determine the best actions to take regarding a threat, but we must do threat modeling first.

### OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021

- Threat modeling should be done early in the software development life cycle.
