## Threat modeling

### Braiterman et al 2020

- Threat modeling means examining all the ways our systems could be compromised and determining how to prevent or protect against these risks before they occur.
- The threat modeling manifesto acts as a guide for creating or improving a threat modeling method that meets the organization’s needs.
- Key questions of threat modeling are:
  1. What are we working on?
  2. What can go wrong?
  3. What are we going to do about it?
  4. Did we do a good enough job?

## a) Security hygiene

- Use strong, unique passwords. Avoid common passwords and do not reuse them. Use a mix of characters, numbers, and symbols. Use a password manager. 
- Avoid sensitive transactions on public Wi-Fi or use a VPN for encryption.
- Enable multi-factor authentication.
- Use antivirus. Regularly scan your devices for malware and viruses.
- Update software if there is an update available. Keep your operating systems, apps, and antivirus software up to date for security updates.
- Be wary of phishing scams. Avoid clicking links from unknown sources.
- Don't share private info on the internet. Be especially careful not to overshare on social media.
- Back up important data. Use external drives for backups.
