HDMH'B TH. KWU'YI AWR WSSTOTMJJK M OWQINYIMLIY! MB KWU BII, BTGPJI BUNBHTHUHTWA OTPDIYB OMA NI NYWLIA RTHD SYIEUIAOK MAMJKBTB. BII KWU MH DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG        
I presume DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG is a link and from which I can presume these letters:
-  D = H
-  H = T
-  P = P
-  O = C
-  W = O
-  G = M
        
Now the text is:          
THMT'B TT. KOU'YI ACR OSSTCTMJJK M COQINYIMLIY! MB KOU BII, BTMPJI BUNBTTUHTOA CTPHIYB CMA NI NYOLIA RTTH SYIEUIACK MAMJKBTB. BII KOU MT HTTP://TIYOLMYCTAIA.COM
              
Now I guess that KOU'YI means you're so now all the changed letters are:
-  D = H
-  H = T
-  P = P
-  O = C
-  W = O
-  G = M
-  K = Y
-  U = U
-  Y = R
-  I = E
            
I'd also have to guess now that THMT'B TT is THAT'S IT which would mean following changes from the original text:
- B = S
- D = H
- G = M
- H = T
- I = E
- K = Y
- M = A
- O = C
- P = P
- T = I
- U = U
- W = O
- Y = R

- HDMH'B TH. KWU'YI AWR WSSTOTMJJK M OWQINYIMLIY! MB KWU BII, BTGPJI BUNBHTHUHTWA OTPDIYB OMA NI NYWLIA RTHD SYIEUIAOK MAMJKBTB. BII KWU MH DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG
- THAT'S IT. YOU'RE AOR OSSICIAJJY A COQENREALER! AS YOU SEE, SIMPJE SUNSTITUTIOA CIPHERS CAA NE NROLEA RITH SREEUEACY AAAJYSIS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROLARCIAEA.COM

Still need to understand what these letters have to be changed to?
- A = ?
- R = ?
- S = ?
- J = ?
- Q = ?
- L = ?
- N = ?
- E = ?
- C = ?

Well firstly, I'd guess OSSICIAJJY is officially so that would reveal that S is F and J is L:
- HDMH'B TH. KWU'YI AWR WSSTOTMJJK M OWQINYIMLIY! MB KWU BII, BTGPJI BUNBHTHUHTWA OTPDIYB OMA NI NYWLIA RTHD SYIEUIAOK MAMJKBTB. BII KWU MH DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG
- THAT'S IT. YOU'RE AOR OFFICIALLY A COQENREALER! AS YOU SEE, SIMPLE SUNSTITUTIOA CIPHERS CAA NE NROLEA RITH FREEUEACY AAALYSIS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROLARCIAEA.COM

AAALYSIS must be Analysis and that would give A = N
- HDMH'B TH. KWU'YI AWR WSSTOTMJJK M OWQINYIMLIY! MB KWU BII, BTGPJI BUNBHTHUHTWA OTPDIYB OMA NI NYWLIA RTHD SYIEUIAOK MAMJKBTB. BII KWU MH DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG
- THAT'S IT. YOU'RE NOR OFFICIALLY A COQENREALER! AS YOU SEE, SIMPLE SUNSTITUTION CIPHERS CAN NE NROLEN RITH FREEUENCY ANALYSIS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROLARCIAEN.COM

Then I guess that NOR is NOW and FREEUENCY is FREQUENCY so R = W and E = Q
- HDMH'B TH. KWU'YI AWR WSSTOTMJJK M OWQINYIMLIY! MB KWU BII, BTGPJI BUNBHTHUHTWA OTPDIYB OMA NI NYWLIA RTHD SYIEUIAOK MAMJKBTB. BII KWU MH DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG
- THAT'S IT. YOU'RE NOW OFFICIALLY A COQENREALER! AS YOU SEE, SIMPLE SUNSTITUTION CIPHERS CAN NE NROLEN WITH FREQUENCY ANALYSIS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROLARCIAEN.COM

SUNSTITUTION must be SUBSTITUTION which would give letters N = B:
- HDMH'B TH. KWU'YI AWR WSSTOTMJJK M OWQINYIMLIY! MB KWU BII, BTGPJI BUNBHTHUHTWA OTPDIYB OMA NI NYWLIA RTHD SYIEUIAOK MAMJKBTB. BII KWU MH DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG
- THAT'S IT. YOU'RE NOW OFFICIALLY A COQEBREALER! AS YOU SEE, SIMPLE SUBSTITUTION CIPHERS CAN BE BROLEN WITH FREQUENCY ANALYSIS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROLARCIAEN.COM

I guess that COQEBREALER is CODEBREAKER and BROLEN is BROKEN. This would give letters:
- Q = D
- L = K

- HDMH'B TH. KWU'YI AWR WSSTOTMJJK M OWQINYIMLIY! MB KWU BII, BTGPJI BUNBHTHUHTWA OTPDIYB OMA NI NYWLIA RTHD SYIEUIAOK MAMJKBTB. BII KWU MH DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG
- THAT'S IT. YOU'RE NOW OFFICIALLY A CODEBREAKER! AS YOU SEE, SIMPLE SUBSTITUTION CIPHERS CAN BE BROKEN WITH FREQUENCY ANALYSIS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROKARCIAEN.COM

And now I'm ready to make the final guess about the whole text which would be:

- THAT'S IT. YOU'RE NOW OFFICIALLY A CODEBREAKER! AS YOU SEE, SIMPLE SUBSTITUTION CIPHERS CAN BE BROKEN WITH FREQUENCY ANALYSIS. SEE YOU AT HTTP://TEROKARVINEN.COM
